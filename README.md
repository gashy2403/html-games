# html-games
HTML Games that work on a school network that doesnt allow applications through usb
This Repository was made to have a place to store games that use HTML 
My school doesnt allow applications to be sent throught to our homedrives so HTML games are the way to go as  you can play them running on your homedrive and the school has no way of blocking it
